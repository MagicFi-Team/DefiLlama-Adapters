Hello, Dear Defillama Team.
Our protocol is registered on Ponzi. I requested to the Dexs.
Anyway, currently, we don't need to list our project to defillama.
So can you delete our protocol on defillama?
If it can't be deleted, can you set categorize to forks from orderly?
Our protocol name is Magic-Fi.
Please help our team and remove it asap.

Best regards,
Magic-Fi Team.
